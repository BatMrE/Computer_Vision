The following models are evaluated in terms of performance, accuracy, and efficiency:

LeNet: One of the earliest convolutional neural networks (CNNs), known for its simplicity and efficiency in processing smaller datasets such as MNIST.

ResNet: A powerful model that introduced residual connections to solve the problem of vanishing gradients, enabling the training of very deep networks.

EfficientNet: A family of models that scales depth, width, and resolution using a compound scaling method, offering high performance with fewer parameters.

MobileNetV2: A lightweight architecture designed for mobile and edge devices, focusing on efficiency with depthwise separable convolutions.

Vision Transformer (ViT): A novel architecture that adapts the transformer model (originally developed for NLP tasks) to process images, treating them as sequences of image patches.

HuggingFace ViT: HuggingFace's implementation of the Vision Transformer, which leverages pretrained models and fine-tuning capabilities for state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks.
